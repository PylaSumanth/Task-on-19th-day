        <p>To the Devi, who abides in all beings in the form of power, salutations to her, salutations to her again and again.</p>
        <section><P><b>Devi Mahatmyam or Chandi</b>, the celebrated scripture on Divine Mother, ecstatically describes Her to be pervading every element and aspect of this universe, not only in the physical dimension but also in every sphere that transcends the ordinary experience. It is heartening that the Mother was given a lofty position all over the world for thousands of years. We find architectural proofs in different parts of the globe that indicate the prevalence of the worship of God as Mother. Also, there was an all-pervasive proclivity in the ancient civilisations to adore the feminine as a symbol of immaculate love, protection, and fertility. Some scholars have also proved that the ancient societies were predominantly matriarchal, which later transformed into patriarchal due to various historical factors that accounted for the subjugation of women by men.</P></section>
